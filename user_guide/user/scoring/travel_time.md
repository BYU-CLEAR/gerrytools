# Travel-time scoring

Travel-time scores use a precomputed, symmetric table of travel times between geographic units.
They evaluate a districting plan without rebuilding or routing the road network.

## Definitions

For a district $D$, let $U_D$ be its units and let $t(i,j)$ be the symmetric travel time between
units $i$ and $j$.

Pairwise travel time uses every unordered pair:

$$
\mathrm{PTT}(D)=\frac{1}{\binom{|U_D|}{2}}
\sum_{\{i,j\}\subseteq U_D} t(i,j)w(i,j).
$$

The pairwise weight is $1$ for `none`, $p_i+p_j$ for `p+p`, and $p_i p_j$ for `p*p`.

Centroid travel time first selects the district unit minimizing weighted travel to every unit:

$$
c_D=\underset{c\in U_D}{\mathrm{arg\,min}}\sum_{u\in U_D}t(c,u)v_u.
$$

Then

$$
\mathrm{CTT}(D)=\frac{1}{|U_D|}
\sum_{u\in U_D}t(c_D,u)v_u.
$$

The centroid weight $v_u$ is $1$ for `none` and the destination population $p_u$ for `p`. The
candidate centroid's population does not independently affect its selection.

Both families also expose the maximum weighted trip. When all population weights are zero, the
weighted mean and maximum are both zero. A singleton district has no pairwise trip and receives
`NaN` scores.

## Score one plan

The public functions accept the same plan sources as other single-plan GerryTools functions: a
GerryChain `Partition`, a NetworkX graph plus assignment, or a GeoDataFrame plus assignment.

```python
from gerrytools.scoring import pairwise_travel_time

district_scores = pairwise_travel_time(
    partition,
    od=travel_time_table,
    population_attr="TOTPOP",
    weight="p+p",
)

plan_mean = district_scores.mean(skipna=False)
worst_district = district_scores.max(skipna=False)
```

`pairwise_travel_time` and `centroid_travel_time` return a Series indexed by district. Use
`travel_time_scores` when the district means, maximum trips, and selected centroids are all
needed.

Unweighted scoring does not require a population attribute. Population-weighted modes require a
finite, nonnegative population for every unit.

## Table requirements

`TravelTimeTable` requires nonnegative symmetric travel times and a zero diagonal. Every included
unit must reach every other included unit. A disconnected table is rejected before scoring so the
set of included trips cannot change with the districting plan.
